Performance of non-contiguous MPI sends

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) has `derived datatypes' routines
for sending non-contiguous data. While these offer an elegant
alternative to explicitly packing a contiguous send buffer, there is
always the question of whether they come with a performance
penalty. We present half a dozen different strategies, on various TACC
platforms, showing some surprising winners and losers.
