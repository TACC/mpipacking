\title{Performance of MPI Sends\\ of Non-Contiguous Data}
\author{Victor Eijkhout}
\date{2020}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  We present an experimental investigation of the performance of MPI
  derived datatypes. While solutions with hardware support can achieve
  high performance, we show that vanilla approaches fall short.
  For messages up to the megabyte range most
  schemes perform comparably to each other and to manual copying into
  a regular send buffer. However, for large messages the internal
  buffering of MPI causes marked differences in efficiency.
  We show how schemes that acknowledge the importance
  of buffer management
  give both the highest performance and a simple usage.
