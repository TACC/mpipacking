  Every ping-pong was timed individually. We used \n{MPI_Wtime}, which
  on our platforms had a resolution of $1\cdot10^{-6}$ seconds, and the
  minimum measurement ever (for the very smallest message) was around
  $6\cdot10^{-6}$ seconds.

  Our code is set up to dismiss measurements that are more
  than one standard deviation from the average.
